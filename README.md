Welcome to the opus README!

Prior to coding, I was a musician and music teacher.  As much as I greatly enjoyed making music with my talented colleagues, my true passion was working with students and helping them tap into their hidden (or in many cases not-so-hidden) talents. Over the years, I found myself leaning quite a bit on technology to improve their practicing habits. I tried excel spreadsheets, audio recording apps, SmartMusic (a play-along app), and even email to correspond with parents.

My ideas worked.  The students improved steadily and I was much more organized when tracking their progress.  But as one could surmise, the experience with this bundle of apps was, to put it nicely, inefficient and time consuming. There were too many apps that did too many different variations of what I was ultimately after. Technology was supposed to make things easier, right?

Between lessons I would find myself fantasizing about the kind of app I would design. I wanted it to organize my schedule.  I wanted it to record and submit their practice recordings. I wanted it to send automated updates to help schedule their practice.  I wanted it to have a payment system so kids would have to carry a wad of cash with them all day before the meet me for their lessons.  I wanted it to do everything, and I wanted it to be simple and intuitive.

Fast forward to the present, I have learned the ways of Javascript, React/Redux, and Ruby on Rails.  With these skills, I have created 'Opus'. This is a simple app that MIGHT be able to do SOME of the following:

- Take student data: Grade, School, Level, Parent Contact-Info, Progress Stats, Payment Info, Profile Pic
- To send out scheduled reminders and emails. Active Email?
- Receive payment ... Stripe??
- Submit recordings ... like Soundcloud?
- Graph out student's progress... need D3?
- Provide play-along options ... playback tracks at different speeds is all I can really do now.
- Connect to wikipedia and Youtube as resources if a student searches a piece of music. Search/Youtube APIs


Again its a rails backend and React frontend, and my first step will be to make a functional app with these APIs within a traditional lap/desktop browser.  Moving forward, I would like to use React Native and port this to a phone. This is a lot!  And likely I am not going to get it all in.  I think I will choose 2 or 3 of the above features and iron them out.  Here's the order I think:

Most Important

1) Student Data
2) Musical Progress Tracker
3) Email blaster

Would be nice

4) Submit recordings
5) SearchAPI from Wiki/Youtube

If things go exceedingly well and I am ahead of schedule

6) React Native
